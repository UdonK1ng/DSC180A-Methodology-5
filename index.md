What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

The most interesting topic was learning about graph databases and using data in order to create graphs. I have never done something like that before so it was interesting exploring that aspect of data analysis. 

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

A potential investigation I would like to pursue for the Quarter 2 project is doing machine learning methods on the data we have collected from the graph database during the Quarter 1 project.  I would like to see what factors in the colormetrics lead to solar cell degredation. 

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

A potential change I would make is making the script run automatically whenever new data is uploaded. 


What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

Some other techniques I would be interested in using are doing clustering in order to find similarites between certain samples.  I would also like to use neural networks to potentially do time series prediction.
